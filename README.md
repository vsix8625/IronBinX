## About This Project

This custom build tool is a work in progress. 
I’ve had a blast building this tool and diving into the world of build systems!
While my tool may not yet reach the levels of established solutions like CMake or Make,
it serves as a great learning platform and offers unique utilities tailored to my projects.

I started coding in 2023, and while I’m excited to share my efforts, I am still learning and may encounter issues in the code. 
Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are welcome as I continue to improve my skills!
