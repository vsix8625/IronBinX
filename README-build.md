## About build process:
  - I used a custom bash to create and compile this project.
  - A copy of the build script is on ../scripts/Ironbin.

  - A simple makefile will be included in build dir.

## Notes:
 - A possible rework of IroBinX is on the way, with probably more features.
       - Multi threading builds for projects with more than 25 files  
       - C dir iteration and detection of source files instead of utilizing the 'find' tool.
