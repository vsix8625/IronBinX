## About build process:  
  - I used a custom bash to create and compile this project.  
  - But from now on Make will be used.  
  - A simple makefile will be included in build dir.  
  - To build run `make` when on the same dir as makefile.  

## Notes:  
 - A possible rework of IroBinX is on the way, with probably more features.
